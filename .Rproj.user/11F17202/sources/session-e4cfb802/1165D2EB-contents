__Note__: Laptops are not required for the competition. Chromebooks will be provided for all attending.

- 10:30-12:00 __The 2024 Data Science Competition__. Students will work on Chromebooks to answer questions related to a dataset.  All questions can be answered using the techniques found in the tutorial and sample dataset on the event's website, and access to this website will be available during the competition.  For students in the doubles division, we will provide nudges in the right direction if you get stuck.  For those in the singles division, we will provide clarification on questions, but not advice on how to solve them.
