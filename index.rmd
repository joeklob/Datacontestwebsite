The above image is used in classifying the famous iris dataset by plotting sepal lengths and widths as a scatterplot. Such a method works great for identifying setosas, but more advanced methods will be needed for successfully distinguishing between versicolors and virginicas (in particular, we'll use k-nearest neighbors on a higher dimensional dataset). In these notes, you will gain methods for visualizing data, and also some methods for making meaningful statements about data. This requires a basic understanding of statistics and probability, which is also covered, with a bent toward "proof by simulation".
